					Relationship is a two way street. And the relationship of alumni and the students of IITG is no different. We, as students of your alma mater, are ready to help you SAIL you through any difficulties faced by you concerning IITG. It could be a major problem like Issuance of Original/Duplicate certificates, grade cards, requirement of Degree Transcripts urgently or a minor problem like visting the campus. We will be making available those transcripts and mailing them to you. We live by the motto "Guests are equivalent to GOD", so we will make sure that you do not face any problem throughout your stay at IITG campus.
